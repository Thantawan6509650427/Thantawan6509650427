# Hi, I’m Thantawan 👋

Final-year Computer Science student at Thammasat University with hands-on experience in system development, software validation, and workflow analysis across web, mobile, and API-based systems.

I am particularly interested in understanding how technology supports real-world business operations — from requirement clarification and system design to implementation and functional validation within structured development environments.
